# Email Sender Automation  

This project is a Python-based script designed to automate the process of sending emails through Microsoft Outlook. It allows for customized email bodies, personalized attachments, and region-specific content for users, all configured via a JSON file.  

## Features  
- **Automated email generation**: Reads user data from a JSON file and sends personalized emails.  
- **Region-specific email content**: Different email bodies for users from Brazil, the USA, and other Latin American countries.  
- **Attachment handling**: Automatically adds attachments based on user-specific file names and extensions.  
- **Outlook integration**: Utilizes Microsoft Outlook installed on the computer to send emails.

---

## How It Works  

The script reads user data from a JSON file (`emails.json`), formats the email content based on the user's region, attaches files matching the user's name, and sends the email using the computer's Outlook application.  

### Required JSON Structure  
The `emails.json` file should be created in the root directory of the project. The file must follow this structure:  

```json
[
  {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "user": "username",
    "country": "BRASIL"
  },
  {
    "email": "anotheruser@example.com",
    "user": "anotherusername",
    "country": "USA"
  }
]
```

### JSON Field Descriptions  
- **`email`**: The recipient's email address.  
- **`user`**: The recipient's username or identifier.  
- **`country`**: The recipient's country. Accepted values are `"BRASIL"`, `"USA"`, or any other country.

## Setup  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PauloRaphael/bulk_email_sender.git
   cd email-sender
   ```  

2. **Create the JSON File**  
   - Add a file named `emails.json` in the project directory.  
   - Populate it using the provided JSON structure.  

3. **Ensure Directory Structure**  
   - Place user-specific files in a subdirectory named `Files` within the project directory.  

4. **Run the Script**  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Notes  

- Emails are sent using the **Outlook application** on your computer. Ensure Outlook is installed and configured correctly.  
- Make sure the JSON file follows the correct structure to avoid errors.  
- Add the `emails.json` file and the `Files` directory to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data.

## Example Usage  

1. Populate the `emails.json` file:  
   ```json
   [
     {
       "email": "john.doe@example.com",
       "user": "johndoe",
       "country": "BRASIL"
     },
     {
       "email": "jane.smith@example.com",
       "user": "janesmith",
       "country": "USA"
     }
   ]
   ```  

2. Place user-specific files in the `Files` directory:  
   - `Files/johndoe_invoice.pdf`  
   - `Files/janesmith_receipt.txt`  

3. Run the script and watch Outlook handle the rest!
